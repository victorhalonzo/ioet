Coding exercise

My solution is based in a application web which the user loads a txt file with the inputs and the results are showed in the page.
The architecture contains an html file and a javascript file.
What I made it was to almacenate the table data in a array which in each position contains the schedules and values in a json.
When the file is loaded the program reads each input and separates the name of the employer and the schedules. Then it iterates the schedules comparing them with the table data. When it finds a coincidence gets the payment value and multiplies it by the number of hours worked. Finally it adds all the payments of that employer.

The metodology I can resume in these steps:
Analyse the problem.
Specify the solution.
Design the solution.
Implement the design.
Test the program.

To run program is necessary to copy the index file and the code.js file in a same folder of the pc. Then open the index file in a web browser. Finally load a txt file with the inputs (you can use the same file there is in the link).
